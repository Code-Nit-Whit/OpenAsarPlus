**A _work-in-progress_ enhancement of the open-source `app.asar` alternative Discord wishes they'd written.**

<sup>Made possible by [GooseMod's](https://github.com/GooseMod) [OpenAsar](https://github.com/GooseMod/OpenAsar)</sup>


## Planned Features
- **All the benefits of OpenAsar**: OpenAsarPlus aims to build upon the featuress of OpenAsar with minimal changes to the existing code, extending the original package's improvements in file size, performance, customizability, and privacy in relative isolation from new features, ensuring simplified maintenance of both codebases with minimal breaking from updates. 
- **Userscripts!**: Run your favorite userscripts in Discord's official desktop client with a native, custom theme-compatible GUI.
- **Additional Auto-Updates**: OpenAsarPlus will inherit updates from the official OpenAsar source, keeping your client up to date and secure. Auto-update features will also be available for select trusted and community driven userscripts.
